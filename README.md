# About me 👋 
Hi everyone, my name is Colin 😊 I'm a second-year PhD student in social and personality psychology program at the University of Toronto 🍁

## Research Interests
I'm interested in diversity-related issues such as what is considered representation for marginalized groups, how to reduce different forms of prejudice, how those issues affect mental well-being. Part of my research also focuses on using psychometric techniques to develop valid assessments and advance measurement equity.

## Projects in Preparation
### Ingroup Prejudice

In this project, we examined how Asian Americans feel when experiencing ingroup prejudice (i.e., prejudice that comes from ingroup members). We found that Asian Americans who were prejudiced against by Asian peers felt significantly less positive towards Asians compared to their baseline attitudes, whereas experiencing prejudice from White peers did not change participants’ attitudes towards Whites.
